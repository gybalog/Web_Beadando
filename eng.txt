<p id="demo">The Hungaroring is a 4.381 km (2.722 mi) motorsport racetrack in Mogyoród, Pest County, Hungary where the Formula One Hungarian Grand Prix is held. In 1986,[1] it became the location of the first Formula One Grand Prix behind the Iron Curtain.[2] Bernie Ecclestone wanted a race in the USSR, but a Hungarian friend recommended Budapest. They wanted a street circuit similar to the Circuit de Monaco to be built in the Népliget[3] – Budapest's largest park – but the government decided to build a new circuit just outside the city[4] near a major highway.</p>
